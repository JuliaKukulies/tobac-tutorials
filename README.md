# tobac-tutorials

Tobac tutorials show different application cases for the cloud and precipitation tracking software tobac using jupyter notebooks. Th rendered versions of our tutorials are provided at [https://fsenf-tobac-tutorials.readthedocs.io](https://fsenf-tobac-tutorials.readthedocs.io). Please have a look there, first!


## Getting Started

Tutorial notebooks for tobac 2.x (currently in active development). Please use them together with the [v2.0-dev](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/v2.0-dev/) development branch. 

A step-by-step description to run the tutorials with jupyter is located [here](docs/RunningTutorials.md).


## Limitations

If you are using tobac 1.x, the notebooks here won#t work because of changes in the code structure. The equivalent notebooks can be found in the [examples](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/master/examples) folder in the [tobac master branch](https://github.com/climate-processes/tobac/tree/master/examples).
